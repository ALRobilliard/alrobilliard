### Hey there, I'm Andrew ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack developer making things in C#, JavaScript, and a few others.
- âœˆ I'm from Canada, but currently living in Auckland, New Zealand
- ðŸ’» I currently work as a D365 CE Developer at [Intergen](https://intergen.co.nz)

These days, my time is primarily spent liasing with clients, and leveraging my knowledge of the Dynamics & CDS platforms to achieve the best outcomes for the business and users.
